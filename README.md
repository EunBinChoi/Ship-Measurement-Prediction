# Ship-Measurement-Prediction-with-CNN-master

## Short Description
- In vessel, there are various parts such as D/HOUSE, H/COVER, Inside E/RM, Inside C/HOLD, Inside WBTK, T/SIDE, S/BTM, F/BTM, Inside Peak TK according to countries where the ship was made, what kind of stuff are you carrying, and What engine the ship uses such as Steam Turbine Engine, MAN Electronic Gas-Injection, Magneto-Hydro Dynamics, etc.
- The goal of this project is to predict the measurement values of each area of the ship according to which engine is used and what goods are being carried in order to reduce the ship design cost when building a new ship.
